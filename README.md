# Home Computing at CSE using WSL2 ðŸ¥³ [WIP]

Welcome to my guide on Home Computing at CSE using WSL2!

Here you will learn how to create and work seamlessly on a Linux environment without having to deal with the pain and suffering that is VLAB or SSH!
> If you are currently a **COMP1511** student, I would advise sticking to `VLAB` or `SSH` for the first few weeks, and then seeking advice from your tutor on creating a local setup.


## Why WSL2 ? ðŸ¤”
You have probably used **TigerVNC** or **SSH** to connect to UNSW's CSE machines before, allowing you to edit your files or execute terminal commands on CSE servers. 

However the **TigerVNC/SSH** experience is not exactly smooth, with issues such as timeouts, disk quota limits, port numbers being stolen, or general unresponsiveness just to name a few. (Also the fact that you need a stable internet connection to connect to CSE in the first place).

This guide will demonstrate how to create and configure a *seamless* local setup whilst still being able to use a lot of the Linux commands and scripts that are taught in the majority of CSE courses,

## What is WSL ? ðŸ§ 

**Windows Subsystem for Linux** (WSL) can be used to run a wide variety of Linux software, including shells, text editors, and programming languages, on a Windows machine. 

It is useful for developers who want to run Linux tools on their Windows machine, but prefer the convenience of a Windows environment.

> This is my first attempt at writing a technical guide ðŸ˜… If there is anything I can improve on, or anything that is unclear/confusing, please don't hesistate to reach out to me at william.huynh3@unsw.edu.au! Thanks! :D
