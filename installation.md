# Installing WSL2

## Preface 🐶

There are two versions of WSL, that being **WSL** & **WSL2**.

This guide will demonstrate the **installation of WSL2**, as it offers both faster performance and is considered the successor to **WSL**. A detailed comparison between both versions can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions).


## Getting Started 🎉

First off, we need to check our Windows build! If you are on **`build 19041`** or later, you can install **WSL2** with a **single command**! 

If you are on an older version, there are a few extra steps, but it is still simple all the same!

>You can check your Windows build by opening **Start** and entering `winver`.

As you can see below, my Windows build is **`build 22000`** which is later than **`build 19041`**. This means I can install **WSL2** with a single command!

>If needed, you can update your build of Windows [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/windows-10-update-assistant-3550dfb2-a015-7765-12ea-fba2ac36fb3f).

## Installing WSL on Build 19041+ 🛠️

2. Search for **Command Prompt**
3. Right-click the top result, and select **Run as administrator** from the menu
4. Type the following command and press **Enter**:

5. And voila! You can confirm your installation, by typing the following command and pressing **Enter**:

## Installing WSL on older builds 👴
Please follow this guide [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/wsl/install-manual).

## Post Installation 🙌
You can launch **WSL2** by opening **Start** on Windows and searching for **Ubuntu**.
> **Ubuntu** is the default linux distribution installed by WSL2. It is very beginner friendly to use and has a lot of documentation + support online. You can check out the documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)!
