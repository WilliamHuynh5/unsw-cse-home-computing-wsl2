# Configuring WSL2 ðŸ”§

If you are here, that means you managed to successfully install WSL2! ðŸ¥³

There are just a few more steps we will take to ensure our WSL setup is ready for you to start programming!

First off, we are going to update our version of **Ubuntu**, to make sure we have the most up to date packages!
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
> You will be prompted to enter in your `sudo password`. Enter in the password you created prior!

> **Ubuntu** will **not** update itself automatically, so it is recommended you do this step semi-frequently!

Great! Now we are going to install some applications and packages that will allow us to begin programming on our WSL setup!
